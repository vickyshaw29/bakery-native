## About Co.finder
Co.finder is a mobile app, where you can match with other like-minded entrepreneurs, build and crowdfund your startup. We believe everyone deserves to be an entrepreneur. 

In order to solve the inaccessibility problem, we have developed a platform just for entrepreneurs.

Our vision is to put a new generation of the startup ecosystem in everyone's pocket. We envision a future where innovation and impact are not tied to someone's privilege, race, gender, or location.
